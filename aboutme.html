            <h2 class="aboutme_h2">Welcome to my Digital Space</h2>
            <p>
                My journey into technology began in childhood, fueled by a passion for gaming and problem-solving. 
                This early fascination led me to explore the mechanics behind digital experiences, setting the foundation for a career in tech.  
                Over the years, I built expertise in customer support and technical troubleshooting, working closely with users to bridge the gap 
                between people and technology. As my understanding of digital ecosystems deepened, I transitioned into web development, 
                specializing in front-end technologies and Solidity to craft interactive and decentralized solutions.

                Blockchain and Web3 became a natural evolution of my work, allowing me to contribute to innovative projects that redefine financial 
                inclusion and digital ownership. My background in psychology has played a key role in shaping my approach to user experience, 
                system optimization, and quality assurance.
